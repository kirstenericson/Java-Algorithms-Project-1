Rectangle class - both

drawTriangleFractal() - Kirsten
drawRectangleFractal() - both
pickRandomColor() - Both did theory, coded by Kirsten
drawFractal() - both

How to compile this program: make sure when prompted to use a capital letter in the begining of your shape.
Otherwise, it will return 0. When drawing Rectangle or Circle, it will not load properly on the first draw.
 Make sure to minimize the canvas and reopen the tab to get the correct fractal image. We believe this is an issue / bug because
 drawing 4 fractals per shape takes much more memory than drawing 3 (which was for the triangle).

Assumptions: pi = 3.141592653589 - squares are considered rectangles as well - the triangles are all isosceles triangles

 Additional feature implemented : random color selection (per recursive shape)
